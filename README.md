# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Datapad Codes
A collection of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge "QR" codes for the datapad game

These are all GIF files, sorted by the actual text they contain. They all should work if you are using your datapad in SWGE east, and they may or may not work in SWGE west as I've never been there. There also may be some missing that are unique to SWGE west, I don't know.

Following the patterns detailed on this repo's wiki, I discovered 97 working codes. You can scan these all through, or just use them for research purposes if you enjoy the hunt. :) Beware, the puzzles get harder and harder the more codes you scan.
